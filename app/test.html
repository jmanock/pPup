<h1>ELISA'S STORY</h1>

      <p>
        Some folks have asked how Patriot Pup came to life and why I have started on this life adventure to share him with all of you and future generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a moment, I’d be humbled to share my story, please read on&hellip;
      </p>
      <p>
        I was blessed to have grown up in Hinton, West Virginia.  A small coal mining / railroad community surrounded by some of the hardest working, giving and loving folks I know.  To do this day, I love going home, seeing familiar faces, sharing stories of days gone by and meeting the newest faces of future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My parents had a medical practice in town.  Daddy was the town doctor and Mom served alongside him at his office as a nurse.  I was the youngest of three children.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was a freshman at Queens University in Charlotte, North Carolina my brother, United States Marine Sgt. Mecot Camara, was killed in Beirut by a suicide bomber that drove a van loaded with explosives into the Marines Barracks killing two hundred forty one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mecot’s story, titled American Brother, and the story of the Beirut Bombing was my first attempt at writing.  I wanted to make sure him and his brothers, those that died and those that survived, were never forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        This laid the foundation for Patriot Pup.  Mecot loved children.  He loved our country and sacrificed his life defending our interests and our freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I felt a strong need that our children learn more about patriotism, what it means and how important it is for our future.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, Patriot Pup (book series) was created with three characters that will always carry the storylines.  First, MECOT being portrayed as a US Marine Drill Instructor.  I do believe had he lived he definitely would have pursued this role in his military career. And, by having him as a main character in this book, I know his legacy will continue and his spirit will keep on living.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my mind, I do have a vision of him growing old along the New River, rafting the rapids with Ritchie Cantrell at Cantrell Ultimate Rafting.  And I know being on the water was his happy place
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, Hank, my youngest son, is being portrayed as Mecot’s nephew. His character, which is true to life, shows he’s always inquisitive, full of adventure and slightly mischievous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, and most importantly, is the character of Patriot Pup.  He is a friendly, mischievous puppy that teaches bravery, loyalty and, most especially, patriotism to our children.

    <!-- <p class='center'>EPISODE IV <br> A NEW HOPE FOR CSS3</p>
    <p>It is a period of vendor wars.</p>
    <p>
      This is a demostration of Star Wars - style scrolling 3d titles in css3. It possibly has no practical purpose whatsoever but it looks great and you can impress your friends.
    </p>
    <p>Before movie-buffs start ranting, I realize Start Wars wasn't the first to use crawling 3d titles, but few of you will remember the Flash Gordon series of the 1936 adaption of HG Wells' "Things to Come".</p>
    <p>
      Also, by mentioning "Star Wars", everyone will understand what I mean. And I'll receive several thousand more views.
    </p>
    <p>The scrolling titles work well in Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Opera doesn't implement 3d transformation yet, but the text will scroll. IE users receive a blank page. A shame, but IE10 should support it.</p>
    <p>
      So how does it work? Well, it's fairly simple. We have an outer absolute DIV (#titles) which is rotated along the X-axis using perspective to give the impression of depth. The same DIV also has an :after psuedo-element which applies a linear gradient so the text appears to fade out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside, we have another absolutely-positioned DIV which contains the text(#titlecontent). The top is set to 100% to ensure it starts off-screen then uses css3 animation to move it upward over time. No Javascript is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will probably need to adjust the movement amount and timing dependng on the quantity of the text you want to show. The 3d depth can also be tweaked in the #titles declaration.
    </p>
    <p>All the code is contained in the single HTML file&hellip;</p>
    <p>Sorry. Couldn't resist it.</p>
    <p>Finally, Han shot first and the original, unadulterated movies remain the best. Stop fiddling with them.</p> -->
