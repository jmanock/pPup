  <h1>PATRIOT PUP <sub>story</sub></h1>
  <div id="titles">
    <div id="titlecontent">
      <p>
        Some folks have asked how PATRIOT PUP came to life and why I have started on this life adventure to share him with each of you!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a moment, I'd be humbled to share my stroy, please read on...
      </p>
      <p>
        I was blessed to have grown up in Hinton, Wast Virginia. A small coal mining / railroad community surrounded by some of the hardest working, griving and loving folks I know. To this day, I love going home and seeing familirar faces, sharing stories of days gone by and meeting the newest faces of future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My parents had a medical practive in town. Daddy was the town doctor and Mom served alongside him at his office as a nurse. I was the youngest of three children.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was a freshman at Queens University in Charlotte, North Carolina my brother, Untied States Marine Sgt. Mecot Camara, was killed in Beirut by a suicide bomber that drove a van loaded with explosives into the Marines Barracks killing 241.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mecot's story, titled AMERICAN BROTHER, and the story of the Beirut Bombing was my first attempt at writing. I wanted to make sure him and his brothers, those that died and those that survived, were never forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        This laid the foundation for PATRIOT PUP. Mecot loved children. He loved our country and sacrificed his life defending our interests our freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I felt a strong need that our children learn more about patriotism, what it means and how important it is for our future.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, PATRIOT PUP (book series) was created with three characters that will always carry the storylines. First, MECOT being portrayed as a US Marine Drill Instructor. I do believe had he lived he definitely would have pursued this role in his military career. And, by having him as a mian character in this book, I know his legacy will continue and his spirit will keep on living.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, HANK, my youngest son, is being portrayed as Mecot's nephew. His character, which is true to life, shoes he's always inquisitive, full of adventure and slightly mischievous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, and most importantly, is the character of PATRIOT PUP. He is a friendly, mischievous puppy that teaches bravery, loyalty and, most especially, patriotism to our children.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the BIG NEWS, we are branding PATRIOT PUP! Check out the new logo below! Thank you Jason Briedenbach, your talent and creativity are much appreciated!!!

      <p>
        And PATRIOT PUP, VOLUME II, BASEBALLS &amp; HOT DOGS! will be released this December!!!
      </p>

        Please know that a portion of book sales will go directly to Just Our Soldiers' Helpers. They are a non-profit organization that sends amazing care packages to our deployed troops.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is my dream, and if you know my, you know I dream big, to create a PATRIOT PUP Movement! Our country could benefit from a little bit of PATRIOT PUP lover right now by not only inspiring patriotism in our children but in each one of us too! I would love PATRIOT PUP to become our American National Mascot!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Does anyone have any connections to The White House or Good Morning America?!?
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, this project was created and will continue, Lord willing, based on the love of a little sister to make sure that all those that have fought for our freedom and defended our nation will newver be forgotten, most especially, her big broghter, Mecot.
      </p>
      <p>
        So.. if you would be so kind as to SHARE, LIKE, BOOKE ME AT YOUR CHILD'S SCHOOL FOR STORYTIME, ANY OTHER EVENTS or WRITE A REVIEW ON AMAZON, I'd be most humbled and thankful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, with PATRIOT PUP, we can make a difference in educating our children about patriotism.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the bottom of my heart ~ thank you for putting up with my PATRIOT PUP love affair and dream. Most especially, thank you Jeff Hughey, Joe, Sam, Hank. I love you to the moon and back!
      </p>
      <p>
        IT'S TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY TO COME TOGETHER AND, JUST MAYBE, A LITTLE PUPPY BY THE NAME OF PATRIOT PUP CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!
